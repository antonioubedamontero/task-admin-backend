# TaskAdmin backend

Task admin backend made with node and express.

## Development Notes

During initial backend development, the usual `feature/` branch convention was not followed, as this was intended as a quick implementation to connect to the frontend and validate core functionality.

Once stabilized, it is recommended to implement a more formal branch structure (such as `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, etc.) to facilitate collaboration and maintenance.
